SIGMA and ISMEAR
===========

Overview
--------

From Sholl book:

In a metal the Brillouin zone can be divided into regions that are occupied and unoccupied by electrons. The surface in k-space that separates these two regions is called the Fermi surface. Leads to difficulty in calculations because the functions that are integrated change discontinuously from nonzero values to zero at the Fermi surface. If no special efforts are made in calculating these integrals, very large numbers of k points are needed to get well-converged results. 

From Kic

Effect of SIGMA and ISMEAR
-----------------
The following values were used as a default for a metallic system for the k-pt convergence testing: sigma=0.2,ismear=1.
