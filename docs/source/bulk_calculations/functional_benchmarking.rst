Functional Benchmarking
============

Overview
-------
what functional to use? 

* Need to balance physical accuracy with computational cost.

* Need to focus on properties of interest.
 * Binding energies
 * Reaction barriers
 * Vibrational frequencies
 * TS geometries
 * Minimum energy geometries


Properties - Physical Accuracy
-------
Need to quantify how accurate DFT predictions are for specified property of interest.
